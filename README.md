Background

All the online auction platforms that currently exist are based on one centralized operation. They rely on
proprietary and closed software. As a result of this centralization, these platforms share the same
limitations. i.e. Lack of transparency, Closed and Limited.
With blockchain, you will overcome these limitations and build a new auction platform that is open to
all, transparent in nature and is peer to peer.
Below are the set of rules that your auction platform will follow. If some rule is missing, assume suitably
and sensibly!
1. Owner of an item announces that an item is up for sale, sets the base price and starts the timer.
2. Each bidder has a fixed amount disposable for auction in his/her wallet. Bidder canâ€™t bid more
than the wallet contents.
3. The bidders place their bids in real time and continue participating in the bidding process until
the time is out.
4. Each bid is visible to other bidders real time along with the name/ID of the bidder
5. Once the time is out, the ownership of the item changes to the highest bidder and the item
holds the info of the bid and ownership details.
6. After successful bid, the money from the highest bidder is transferred to the owner of the item.
7. If there is no bidder, mark the item as unsold.
8. Each participant in the ecosystem can be an owner or a bidder (not both at once).
Stakeholders:
1. Owner
2. Bidders
